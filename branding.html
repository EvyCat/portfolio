      <p class="text-center"> In this exsercise, I re-designed a logo for an Ottawa vegan and vegetarian restaraunt, The Green Door. The goal was to bring a more current and modern appeal to the logo. By using simple shapes and clean imagery, I feel this goal was met. The design process involved sketching logos and text over and over, in as many different ways as possible to expend all creative options.  </p>
