      <p>I graduated from graphic design at Algonquin College in spring 2019, finishing the three year program with a six-week internship at Canadian Geographic. During school I worked with MicroMetrics for two summers as a designer and assisting with marketing, creating mostly B2B content. I currently work full time as a designer for WOW Tech Group in Ottawa, ON.

I'm passionate about typography, marketing, branding and correcting anyone when they say font but mean typeface... I'm constantly challenging myself, looking for new opportunities to learn and experience new things.
