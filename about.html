      <p>I became a graphic designer to redeem myself after my second grade teacher said my cursive was atrocious. Now my hand lettering would impress Ludovico Degli Arrighi, so… who’s the atrocious one now.</p>
      <p>Currently residing in Ottawa, and in my third year of the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. Passionate about typography, layout and correcting anyone when they say font but mean typeface. I'm constantly challenging myself, looking for new opportunities to learn and experience new things.</p>
      <P> Say Hello! Id love to work with you
