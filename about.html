      <p>I became a graphic designer to redeem myself after my second grade teacher said my cursive was atrocious. Today, my hand lettering would impress Ludovico Degli Arrighi, so… who’s the atrocious one now.</p>
      <p>Currently residing in Ottawa, and completing my third year of the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. Passionate about typography, layout, branding and correcting anyone when they say font but mean typeface. I'm constantly challenging myself, looking for new opportunities to learn and experience new things. Now finishing up a six week internship at Canadian Geographic Magazine, Im looking to expand my knowledge and experience different avenues in the industry.</p>
      <P> Say Hello! Id love to work with you
